## Assigment 

A. Basic requirement: The project involves several steps/tasks, including:

1. Identifying the syntax and grammar rules of American English: This involves analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences in American English and identifying the different parts of speech and how they are used in sentences.
2. Developing a set of context-free grammar rules: Based on the analysis of American English syntax and grammar, develop a set of context-free grammar rules that can be used to generate valid sentences in American English.
  <br />a. Defining a set of nonterminal symbols that represent parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions.
  <br />b. Defining a set of terminal symbols that represent words in the English language.
  <br />c. Defining production rules that describe how nonterminal symbols can be expanded
  into other nonterminal symbols and terminal symbols.
3. Implementing a parser for the context-free grammar using Java/Python/C++: Develop a
parser that can take a sentence generated by the context-free grammar and parse it into a parse tree, which can be used to represent the structure of the sentence.
a. Your parser will be implemented using Java/Python/C++
4. Testing the context-free grammar: Test the context-free grammar by generating random sentences and verifying that they are valid sentences in American English.
a. You are free to make your own test cases for your parser
